# Rasende Roboter

This project is an implementation of a German game, [**Rasende Roboter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_Robots).

In this repository you will find the **full implementation** of the game in Python 3.12 using the librairy [**Pygame**](https://www.pygame.org/news). A part is dedicated to the implementation of a solver (IA). The **main goal** is to play against it. 

This work is a part of a school project that we made with [**@nonolintello**](https://github.com/nonolintello) and [**@gabflrt**](https://github.com/gabflrt)
